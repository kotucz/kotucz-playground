Caveats


High level API (package org.odejava)

There exists some documentation but it is still unfinished. Also some API changes are likely to happen.


Low level API documentation (package org.odejava.ode)

No javadoc, full documentation is at q12.org/ode


ODE at odejava/compile/ode

Package has been tested with ODE source code that is based on 0.39 release.
dCylinder contrib section has been integrated to code, also minor changes
have been done to couple of ODE's function headers.
