<p>
Used to bind ODE to the display library of your choice.  As ODE is purely a
mathematical physics library, it has no inherent way of displaying the 
various objects in the scene.
</p>

<p>
Using this package, ODE objects such as <code>Geom</code> and <code>Body</code> can be ``bound'' to
display objects from any given display API.   This means that when those
objects move in the ODE scene, the corrosponding representation in the display
library will also be moved. The <code>DisplayBin</code> object is used to 
maintain a list of such bound objects in the scene and keep them in sync.
</p>

<p>
To use a graphics package with Odejava - all that is needed is to implement
the <code>DisplayTransformable</code> interface with regards to the chosen
display library.  All that interface specifies is a way for setting the
translation and rotational components of the display object so it can be
synched to the ODE one.
</p>

<p>
In addition to implementing <code>DisplayTransformable</code>, display libraries
can have a utility class which is given Odejava <code>Geom</code>S and <code>Body</code>S
and can automatially generate appropriate representations of them in the display
library using the Geometry properties.
</p>

<p>
Examples of both a DisplayTransformable implementation and utility class can be seen
in the <p>org.odejava.xith3d</p> package.
