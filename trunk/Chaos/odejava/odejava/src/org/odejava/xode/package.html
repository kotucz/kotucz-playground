XODE is an XML based scene format for ODE.  This package is a sample
implementation of an XODE parser.  The classes XODEBody, XODEObject etc
corrilate to elements in the file format.  As the format has additional
data which is not stored in ODE (such as groups) - this is stored
in a tree using these objects.  Those that have ODE representations 
such as Body - will have a Body object with that data so it isn't 
duplicated.

The sample implementation uses a DOM parser which may not be the most
suitable for every use.  Adding SAX support shouln't be too hard - 
probably the easiest way would be to add an overloaded constructor
to the XODE* objects to take the relevent SAX objects (as they currently
do the DOM ones.
